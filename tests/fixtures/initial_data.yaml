    title: All You Need Is Love
    body: |
      Love, Love, Love.
      Love, Love, Love.
      Love, Love, Love.

      There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
      Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
      Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game.
      It's easy.

      Nothing you can make that can't be made.
      No one you can save that can't be saved.
      Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time.
      It's easy.

      All you need is love.
      All you need is love.
      All you need is love, love.
      Love is all you need.

      All you need is love.
      All you need is love.
      All you need is love, love.
      Love is all you need.

      Nothing you can know that isn't known.
      Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
      Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be.
      It's easy.

      All you need is love.
      All you need is love.
      All you need is love, love.
      Love is all you need.

      All you need is love (All together, now!)
      All you need is love. (Everybody!)
      All you need is love, love.
      Love is all you need (love is all you need)
      (love is all you need) (love is all you need)
      (love is all you need) Yesterday (love is all you need)
      (love is all you need) (love is all you need)

      Yee-hai!
      Oh yeah!
      love is all you need, love is all you need,love is all you need, love is all you need, oh yeah oh hell yea! love is all you need love is all you need love is all you need

    title: Can't Buy Me Love
    body: |
      Can't buy me love, love
      Can't buy me love

      I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright
      I'll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright
      I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love

      I'll give you all I got to give if you say you'll love me too
      I may not have a lot to give but what I got I'll give to you
      I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love

      Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
      Can't buy me love, no no no, no

      Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied
      Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy
      I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love
      Owww

      Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
      Can't buy me love, no no no, no

      Say you don't need no diamond rings and I'll be satisfied
      Tell me that you want those kinds of things that money just can't buy
      I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love

      Can't buy me love, love
      Can't buy me love

    title: Get Back
    body: |
      Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
      But he knew it couldn't last
      Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
      For some California grass

      Get back, get back
      Get back to where you once belonged
      Get back, get back
      Get back to where you once belonged
      Get back, Jojo
      Go home

      Get back, get back
      Back to where you once belonged
      Get back, get back
      Back to where you once belonged
      Get back, Jo

      Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
      But she was another man
      All the girls around her say she's got it coming
      But she gets it while she can

      Get back, get back
      Get back to where you once belonged
      Get back, get back
      Get back to where you once belonged
      Get back, Loretta
      Go home

      Get back, get back
      Get back to where you once belonged
      Get back, get back
      Get back to where you once belonged
      Oooh...

      Get back, Loretta
      Your mama's waiting for you
      Wearing her high-heel shoes
      And her low-neck sweater
      Get back home, Loretta

      Get back, get back
      Get back to where you once belonged
      Get back, get back
      Get back
      Oh, yeah
